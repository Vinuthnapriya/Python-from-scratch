SETS:

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items
Sets are written with curly brackets.
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
The values True and 1 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates
The values False and 0 are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates
A set can contain different data types
It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.




Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
